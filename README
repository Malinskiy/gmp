GMP 5.0.2 for Android

This repository contains a prebuilt copy of GMP compiled with the Android NDK r5c against API level 5 (Android 2.0, Donut).

Installation in an Android project:

 1. Check out a copy of this repository into your jni folder, using something like this:
    $ git submodule add git://github.com/Rupan/gmp.git
 2. Add "gmp" to APP_MODULES in Application.mk
 3. Add "gmp" to LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES in your module's Android.mk as required.
    Include gmp.h as required in source files.

Usage at runtime:

The GMP library must be loaded at runtime prior to dependent modules (this is a limitation of Android).
Do something like this in your Java source code:

  ...
  System.loadLibrary("gmp");
  System.loadLibrary("myBNmodule");
  ...

The script used to build the included libraries is named "compile-gmp.sh".  Build options are documented therein.
