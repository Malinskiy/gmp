GMP 5.0.2 for Android

This repository contains a prebuilt copy of GMP compiled with the Android NDK r7 against API level 9 (which corresponds to Android "Gingerbread" 2.3.1).

Installation and usage in an Android project:

 1. Check out a copy of this repository into your jni folder, using something like this:
    $ git submodule add git://github.com/Rupan/gmp.git jni/gmp
 2. Add "gmp" to APP_MODULES in jni/Application.mk
 3. Add "gmp" to LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES in your module's Android.mk as required.
 4. Use GMP as normal by including gmp.h in your source files where required.

Usage at runtime:

The GMP library must be loaded prior to other dependent modules.  This is an apparent shortcoming / limitation of Android.
To handle this condition, do something like the following in your Java source code:

  ...
  System.loadLibrary("gmp");
  System.loadLibrary("myBNmodule");
  ...

The script used to compile and package the prebuilt libraries is named "compile-gmp.sh".  The build procedure is documented therein.

Notes:

Ideally it would be good to run the test suite on a target device.  However, 'make test' dies after attempting to run a cross-compiled binary
on the host system and the problem seems somewhat nontrivial to fix.  Patches and/or suggestions are welcome.

The armeabi-v7a-neon build is now provided.  Move the shared object into the armeabi-v7a directory as e.g. "libgmp-neon.so".  The correct shared object
must be loaded at runtime by the application through the cpufeatures static library.  See the NDK documentation, or just stick with the armeabi-v7a build.
